# Homework Task Tracker
**Motivation**

Fun project that has practical uses for me personally (I am terrible at keeping a planner). I have wanted to learn some basics
in Web Development for a while now, as well as working with Databases and SQL. This project will allow me to do all those 
things and have some fun coding something new. 

**Current Goal**

(1) Have a robust login page, utilizing PostgreSQL to store login information and allow users to have a unique homework/task
viewer for the classes they are taking and projects they are working on. 

**Progress**

(1) Have made the basic form and layout of the site, I want to add some more complexity to it in terms of how aesthetically
pleasing it is (the CSS aspect of the project!)
(2) Currently learning the basics of SQL and working with the PostgreSQL framework
(3) Want to get my database for this specific project set up
(4) Create an entry with a test account that can be used to play with features

**Learnings**

(1) HTML
(2) CSS
(3) Flask
(4) JavaScript (somewhat)
(5) SQL
(6) PostgreSQL
