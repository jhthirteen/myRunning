# Running Tracker
**Motivation**
Upon registering for the Philadelphia half marathon, I thought it could be cool to work on some web application that automatically tracks my progress and keeps track of my plan for me -> as well as being an interesting coding project over the summer
**Goals**
(1) Be able to enter a weekly plan (that automatically renders upon a new week) 
(2) Be able to enter training data
(3) At the start of each day have some interface that plans your day
(4) Keep track of nutritional information
**Heavier Goals**
(5) Somehow upload running routes
(6) Leverage some machine learning model to recommend new workouts -> new running routes / locations around me to run??
