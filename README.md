# Running Tracker
**Motivation**

Upon registering for the Philadelphia half marathon, I thought it could be cool to work on some web application that automatically tracks my progress and keeps track of my plan for me -> as well as being an interesting coding project over the summer

**Goals**

(1) Be able to enter a weekly plan (that automatically renders upon a new week) 
(2) Be able to enter training data
(3) At the start of each day have some interface that plans your day
(4) Keep track of nutritional information

**Heavier Goals**

(5) Somehow upload running routes
(6) Leverage some machine learning model to recommend new workouts -> new running routes / locations around me to run??

**Progress**

-> Added a functional GUI on the 'home' page that prompts for a login
-> Figured out how to utilize a button element and load a subsequent user page with some JavaScript
-> Figured out how to pass the user info as a url paramater and parse that upon the new page loading
-> Tomorrow want to work on the user design and maybe get back to some C++ coding :)
